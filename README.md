## âš¡&nbsp;&nbsp;Usage

### Install
```bash
pip install baseflow
```
<br>


### Example
```python
import baseflow
```
<br>



## Project Structure
The directory structure of baseflow looks like this:
```
â”œâ”€â”€ methods                 <- implements for 12 baseflow separation methods
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ recession_analysis      <- tools for estimating recession coefficiency
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ param_estimate          <- backward and calibration approaches to estimate other parameters
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ comparison              <- an evaluation criterion to comparison different methods
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt        <- File for installing baseflow dependencies
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## ðŸ“Œ&nbsp;&nbsp;Todo


### Nolinear reservoir assumption
- Implement the nolinear reservoir assumption from the [paper](https://github.com/xiejx5/watershed_delineation/releases)
- Employ a time-varing recession coefficiency for baseflow separation
<br>

### Applicable to other time scales
1. The current version only applies to the daily scale
2. The package needs to be updated to support hourly baseflow separation
