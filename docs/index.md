# ðŸŒŸ baseflow

baseflow is a Python package that provides a collection of functions for baseflow separation, which is the process of separating the baseflow component from the total streamflow.

This project is funded by [CIROH](https://ciroh.ua.edu/) and aims to extend the functionality of the original baseflow package by adding new features and improvements. Our goal is to continuously enhance and maintain this package, keeping it up-to-date with the latest developments in baseflow separation techniques.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

â”œâ”€â”€ methods <- implements for 12 baseflow separation methods  
â”‚    
â”œâ”€â”€ separation <- compute baseflow and compare different separation methods  
â”‚    
â”œâ”€â”€ param_estimate <- estimates recession coefficient & backward and calibration approaches to estimate other parameters   
â”‚  
â”œâ”€â”€ comparison <- an evaluation criterion to compare different
methods (KGE) & compute strict baseflow  
â”‚    
â””â”€â”€ utils <- helper functions
