# ðŸŒŸ BASEFLOW

baseflow is a Python package that provides a collection of functions for baseflow separation, which is the process of separating the baseflow component from the total streamflow.

This project is funded by [CIROH](https://ciroh.ua.edu/) and aims to extend the functionality of the original baseflow package by adding new features and improvements. Our goal is to continuously enhance and maintain this package, keeping it up-to-date with the latest developments in baseflow separation techniques.
