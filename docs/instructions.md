# Instructions

## **API Tutorial**

### *Installation*

We have developed a Python package named `baseflow` that provides tools for baseflow separation. This package is available on PyPI and can be easily installed using pip:

```python
pip install baseflow
```

### *Basic Tutorial*

To help you get started with the baseflow package, we have created a Colab notebook that demonstrates its usage. The notebook includes the following content:

- **Introduction**: An overview of baseflow separation and the purpose of the baseflow package.
- **Installation**: Instructions on how to install the baseflow package in the Colab environment.
- **Basic Usage**: Examples of how to use the main functions of the baseflow package to perform baseflow separation on sample data.
- **Advanced Features**: Demonstrations of advanced features and customization options available in the baseflow package.
- **Visualization**: Techniques for visualizing the results of baseflow separation using popular Python libraries such as Matplotlib.

    You may wish to make a copy of the notebook in your own Google Drive.

!!! tip

    Run each cell of the notebook by hitting the play button on the left side of each cell and provide the necessary inputs by following the prompts.

    The notebook is divided into multiple sections and each section contains a set of cells, each of which contains Python code. When you first launch the notebook, the sections are collapsed and you need to expand each section to view and run the code.

#### Part 1: Separation Methods

In this section, we will introduce the different methods available in the baseflow package for performing baseflow separation:

 - Overview of the various algorithms and techniques implemented in the baseflow package.
 - Method Descriptions: Detailed descriptions of each method, including their theoretical background and use cases.
 - Code Examples: Python code snippets demonstrating how to apply each method using the baseflow package.

#### Part 2: Example on a Single Station

This section provides a step-by-step example of how to perform baseflow separation on data from a single hydrological station. We will use sample data to demonstrate the process, from loading the data to visualizing the results.

 - Loading Data: Instructions on how to load streamflow data for a single station.
 - Applying Separation Methods: Applying the separation methods introduced in Part 1 to the loaded data.
 - Visualization: visualizing the baseflow separation results.
We hope this notebook helps you understand how to effectively use the baseflow package for your baseflow separation needs.
