## **Baseflow Separation Application Programming Interface (API)**

### *Baseflow Package*

We have developed a Python package named `baseflow` that provides tools for baseflow separation. This package is available on PyPI and can be easily installed using pip:

```python
pip install baseflow
```

### *Baseflow API Google Colaboratory Notebook*

To help you get started with the baseflow package, we have created a Colab notebook that demonstrates its usage. The notebook includes the following content:

- **Introduction**: An overview of baseflow separation and the purpose of the baseflow package.
- **Installation**: Instructions on how to install the baseflow package in the Colab environment.
- **Basic Usage**: Examples of how to use the main functions of the baseflow package to perform baseflow separation on sample data.
- **Advanced Features**: Demonstrations of advanced features and customization options available in the baseflow package.
- **Visualization**: Techniques for visualizing the results of baseflow separation using popular Python libraries such as Matplotlib.
