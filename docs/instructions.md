## **Baseflow Separation Application Programming Interface (API)**

### *Baseflow Package*

We have developed a Python package named `baseflow` that provides tools for baseflow separation. This package is available on PyPI and can be easily installed using pip:

```python
pip install baseflow
```

### *Baseflow API Google Colaboratory Notebook*

To help you get started with the baseflow package, we have created a Colab notebook that demonstrates its usage. The notebook includes the following content:

- **Introduction**: An overview of baseflow separation and the purpose of the baseflow package.
- **Installation**: Instructions on how to install the baseflow package in the Colab environment.
- **Basic Usage**: Examples of how to use the main functions of the baseflow package to perform baseflow separation on sample data.
- **Advanced Features**: Demonstrations of advanced features and customization options available in the baseflow package.
- **Visualization**: Techniques for visualizing the results of baseflow separation using popular Python libraries such as Matplotlib.

You can access the Colab notebook here:

!!! note You may wish to make a copy of the notebook in your own Google Drive.


!!! note Run each cell of the notebook by hitting the play button on the left side of each cell and provide the necessary inputs.The notebook is divided into multiple sections and each section contains a set of cells, each of which contains Python code. When you first launch the notebook, the sections are collapsed and you need to expand each section to view and run the code.

We hope this notebook helps you understand how to effectively use the baseflow package for your baseflow separation needs.
